# RefactorCSS

In this process I took a client's HTML and CSS code and cleaned it up and checked it's quality. 

The steps I took to do this were: 
  1. Check to make sure all links were working 
  2. Add alt to all images 
  3. Re-organize CSS to follow the HTML layout 
  4. Condense CSS code when applicable 
  5. Comment on all lines of CSS to explain the process
